# 🎬 Sentiment-Based Recommender System

This project implements a **Recommendation System** that combines **Sentiment Analysis** with a **Recommendation Engine**.  
Instead of only recommending content based on popularity or similarity, this system also considers **user sentiments from reviews** to generate more personalized recommendations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Collected and preprocessed comments reviews dataset.  
- Performed **sentiment analysis** on user reviews using NLP techniques.  
- Built a **content-based recommendation system** (using similarity measures).  
- Integrated **sentiment polarity scores** with recommendations for better personalization.  
- Evaluated performance with accuracy, F1-score, and recommendation relevance.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries & Tools:**  
  - Pandas, NumPy (data handling)  
  - Scikit-Learn (ML models, TF-IDF vectorization)  
  - NLTK / TextBlob / VADER (sentiment analysis)  
  - Cosine Similarity (recommendation engine)  
  - Flask / Streamlit (for deployment, optional)  
  - Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/sentiment-recommender.git
   cd sentiment-recommender
2.Install dependencies:

    ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt


3.Run the Jupyter Notebook for training & testing:

    ```bash
      jupyter notebook


4.(Optional) Run the web app:
     
     ```bash
     python app.py


📊 Results

- Sentiment Analysis Model: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF

- Accuracy: 92%

- The recommender system improves relevance by incorporating sentiment polarity.

- Example: If a user liked Inception with positive sentiment, the system recommends similar movies with positive reviews.

🌟 Future Improvements

- Incorporate Deep Learning models (LSTMs, BERT) for better sentiment accuracy.

- Add Hybrid Recommendations (combine collaborative + content-based filtering).

- Deploy as a scalable web application with a database backend.
